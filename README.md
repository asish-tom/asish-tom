## Summary

As a seasoned software engineer, I am driven by a passion for innovation, a commitment to fostering collaborative environments, and a continuous pursuit of learning. With extensive experience in leading software engineering, cloud management, and DevOps, I specialise in optimising systems, scaling services, and guiding cross-functional teams to exceed objectives. I’m a confident engineer, enthusiastic leader, and efficient team player.

My career began as a Backend Software Engineer in startups, where I encountered the recurring challenge of bridging the gap between Development and Infrastructure. This puzzle ignited my curiosity and steered me toward DevOps and cloud solutions. Since then, I have dedicated myself to resolving these intricate challenges, from debugging configurations and developing in-house Infrastructure-as-Code frameworks to addressing developers’ concerns and optimising business costs with modern tech stacks.

Throughout this journey, I have expanded my expertise through continuous learning and certifications, deepening my knowledge in Cloud, Cybersecurity, DevOps, and emerging technologies. I am pursuing a master’s in AI at the University of Western Australia, further enhancing my skills and staying at the forefront of technological advancements.
